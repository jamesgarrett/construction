                    		<p>While most real estate professionals are purveyors of the American Dream, Izabela Sloma stands as its physical embodiment. Over the course of her 10 years working in Chicago’s luxury real estate market, Izabela has established herself as the city’s premier provider of a comprehensive and elegantly refined home buying or selling experience. She has been marked as a Top Residential Producer by the Chicago Association of Realtors every year since 2010, and has accumulated over $200 million in total sales volume since 2007, placing her firmly in the Top 1% of all Chicagoland agents. Yet it is not the constant redefining of market standards that separates Izabela from her industry peers, but rather the unmatched dedication and client-first philosophy with which she approaches each and every transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Izabela’s ascension to Senior VP, Sales at Jameson Sotheby’s International Real Estate was anything but traditional, having followed a path to success that would make Horatio Alger proud. Her story began, as many of the best do, at the fateful intersection of opportunity and initiative. After tiring of making just enough to pay the bills while working multiple odd jobs – from cleaning houses (not unlike the ones she now sells) to tending bar – Izabela convinced her then car insurance agent that she was the right fit for an entry-level position at State Farm. Her unmatched work-ethic and desire to succeed quickly payed dividends, as she leveraged the experience amassed during her rapid climb up the State Farm ranks to secure a mortgage broker métier. As a broker, however, she was frequently exposed to the frustrations many had experienced while searching for their new home; time after time, her clients seemed overtly stressed by a process that Izabela believed should be satisfying and celebratory. And despite the uncertainty of the market in the wake of the 2007 financial collapse, Izabela set out to manifest that belief into a reality.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Izabela entered the Chicago real estate market with a fresh perspective that allowed her to immediately challenge the market’s pervasive “that’s just how things are done" attitude. Before the market crash, bottom-line figures had always defined success, but Izabela’s prioritization of client satisfaction and cultivation of relationships predicated on trust and transparency quickly proved that the road less travelled oft leads to triumph. Izabela’s methodology undoubtedly confronted the <em>status quo</em>, but through the utilization of her fluency in Polish and commitment to a people-first philosophy, she had soon developed a system of vertical integration comprised of a large network of builders, developers, and rehabbers that gave her a competitive advantage in what had become a volatile market.&nbsp;</p><p>Her success continued to build as a product of hard work and the cultivation of genuinely symbiotic relationships, leading the name “Izabela Sloma” to become synonymous with client satisfaction and elegantly-accessible luxury.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Now certified by the Chicago Association of Realtors as a Negotiation Expert, Izabela provides her clients with a level of dedication and seamless home buying or selling experiences that are unmatched in the Second City. Now more than ever, Izabela’s business philosophy is characterized by a passion for helping others realize their dreams; “I love my job,” she says with a smile, “lot’s of people seem to think closing a deal is the best part, but they’re wrong. Nothing is better – more rewarding – than moving day, then helping someone begin their life in the home they’ve been dreaming of.” For Izabela, “people first” is not simply a catchy slogan, but rather an outlook that foundationally defines her everyday approach to life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Izabela currently resides in the West Loop, a neighborhood she was initially drawn to for its “diversely relaxed” atmosphere, with her self-described “four- legged baby” – a Doberman Pinscher named Max. When not brokering deals and helping rehabbers, she enjoys trying out Chicago’s many restaurants and connecting with the greater- Chicago community through her support for the Chicago Children’s Choir and the pediatric cancer foundation, Bear Necessities.&nbsp;</p>

                    		<p>Defined by her strong work ethic and goal-oriented attitude, Kate Penkova adds yet another dimension to Sloma Real Estate Group’s ability to provide every client with an unforgettable experience. Having initially been enticed by the dynamism inherent to the field, Kate began her real estate career in 2009, and has relished every opportunity to explore novel locations and engage with new people since beginning to work alongside Izabela in 2013. Like the rest of the SREG team, Kate exemplifies a genuine “people-first” philosophy, and approaches every transaction with an unwavering determination to provide the best service possible. The bilingual, Petrich, Bulgaria native takes pride in being described by previous clients as “efficient,” “organized,” and “trustworthy,” and derives an ardent passion for her work from the excitement that every opportunity to find her clients the home of their dreams provides. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Kate loves riding her bike around the beautiful city of Chicago, and enjoys spending her time outside of work volunteering at local pet shelters or at lounging on the beach with a good book in hand. When asked what she would not be able to live without, Kate responded without hesitation, “my pets, pictures, and some items from my childhood.” She currently resides in Lincoln Square.&nbsp;</p>

                    		<p>Molly Moran brings a uniquely creative perspective and her eye for design to the position of Marketing Coordinator for Sloma Real Estate Group. Born and raised in the small picturesque town of Monson, MA, Molly translated her intrinsic leadership skills and love for competition into a Division 1 soccer scholarship at Fairfield University, where she graduated Cum Laude with a major in Marketing, minor in Business Management, and concentration in Integrated Marketing Communications. Although she stands as the youngest member of the SREG team, Molly brings an impressively comprehensive marketing background and west coast-inspired contemporary flair to the Chicago luxury market. Quite fittingly, Molly discovered her passion for real estate while interning at Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty in San Diego, CA, where she realized that it was the perfect intersection of her background in marketing and love for interior design. Coupled with her innate organizational skills and unrivaled attention to detail, Molly’s soccer-instilled collaborative attitude and indefatigable work-ethic make her the logistical maestro behind SREG’s success.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Outside of work, Molly is defined by her indescribable love for animals, which was fostered while growing up in a household full of puppies. Before moving to Chicagoland, Molly worked as a foster and volunteer for Little Black Dog Rescue, and has worked extensively in raising awareness about &amp; caring for animals in need. She currently resides in Lakeview with her boyfriend and two cats, Ender and Gryffin.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p></p><p>When I first met Izabela I had a small budget, yet she was more than happy to work with me. I ended up deciding that I needed to rent awhile so I could save up money in order to afford the home I was wanting. After about a year I contacted her again. She is extremely knowledgeable and great at what &nbsp;she does. She never makes you feel pressured and is 100% honest through the whole process. Izabela really cares about her clients and will help you in any way she can. Izabela helped me buy my first home with ease. I would definately use her again without thinking twice.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>Izabela has all the qualities someone who is serious about home-buying could want. From the onset, I was impressed by her responsiveness and knowledge on just about everything we encountered along the way. She returned my calls quickly and stayed on top of everything. She was able to differentiate <span id="yui_3_18_1_1_1503415724993_4277">&nbsp;between tasks that needed attention immediately, and tasks that were important but slightly less urgent--and Izabela clearly understood the difference. When I expressed a serious interest in a property, she was exceptional in arranging showings as quickly as reasonably possible. During showings, Izabela was a tremendous advocate for my wife and I. When a property featured something uniquely beneficial to us, she would point it out. When other properties indicated potential red flags, she would explain the risks in easy-to-understand terms. Over the weeks my wife and I had the pleasure of working with her, we were always greeted with a smile and a pleasant, professional demeanor.<br><br>During the process, we had no doubts that we had made an excellent choice for our realtor. Most importantly, Izabela made my wife and I feel that our search for the right house was as important to her as it was to us.<br><br>I am so convinced of her talents, I would not hesitate to recommend Izabela Sloma to my closest friends and relatives, let alone anyone else looking for a great agent</span></p><p></p>

I wouldn't trade her in for anyone, she is the &nbsp;most hard working individual you will ever meet, she makes sure all my deals are perfectely executed and works beyond what she should be doing, always making sure everyone is happy. She is the true definition of a real profesional agent that's not only there for you during the deal but long time after. I would recomend Izabela to everyone. She a real experienced agent with her head on her shoulders that would always do anything to make everyone happy. There is no one like Izabela Sloma.</p><p></p>

We were looking into purchasing a home but were only wanting to look at what was out there on the internet at first to ease us into the whole process and Izabela was more than understanding and willing to &nbsp;help email us listings. Unlike most Realtors she wasn't calling us everyday pressuring us to start looking, which we truly did appreciate. When we were ready we let her know and the search quickly began with us seeing over 50 plus homes most we choosen to see and some that she wanted us to see as well. Since we were first-time home buyers she gave us her opinion when we asked and she pointed things out things that were wrong or could possibly cost us money to repair. &nbsp;She was persistant and followed up quickly with all of our offers and explained everything that was going on step by step. When our offer was accepted she was on point with everything and was available to us at all times throughout the entire closing process. &nbsp;Izabela was AWESOME &nbsp;and wennt above and beyond for us and I would recommend her to anyone looking to purchase a home anywhere. I am willing to answer any questions, just ask.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>Izabela Sloma is by far, one of the best real estate agents I have ever dealt with, and trust me, I've dealt with a lot of agents. Izabela does not waste your time, and shows you the exact type of homes that you are looking for. Also, she is on top of everything, and is very attentive to all your &nbsp;home-buying needs. Another thing that struck me about Izabela, which I did not see in other agents, is that she really cares about making sure the property u are interested in is really a good property and has no major issues. Izabela really made me feel comfortable and at the end of our home buying experience, I felt like she was apart of our family. She is really an awesome person as well as a great experienced Real Estate agent. I guarantee, you will not be dissapointed if u choose her to be your agent.</p><p></p>

                            <p></p><p>Izabela is an extremely knowledgeable and sharp agent. &nbsp;I've been through three other agents in my life, and I have not met one as relentless as her. &nbsp;She carefully listened to my preferences and only showed me properties that would appeal to my personal needs and my style. &nbsp;I never felt like she <span id="yui_3_18_1_1_1503415724993_4188">&nbsp;showed me a house that was a far stretch from my needs. &nbsp;At one point, my needs changed, and she was on board to help me search for a different type of home completely. <br><br>Also, I had an extremely uncertain fate with the mortagage process as two banks had recently denied me; despite these setbacks and what looked to be like a forboding case, Izabela still stuck with me until the end and never lost faith in my ability to procure a home. &nbsp;<br><br>Izabela is an agent who will call her client as soon as she knows something because she is a firm believer of constant and accurate communication. Even more, she works intermittently with the mortgage broker and makes sure he/she is moving as expeditiously as possible. &nbsp;I happened to be out of town when buying a home in Chicago, and she willfully gave up her time to work with me through phone, email, and fax. Izabela is the person whose business hours go beyond the typical 8-5 workday; her day ends well beyond that time--when she feels she has met her client's case's needs for that day. <br><br>Lastly, another great perk about Izabela is that she is highly respected in this industry and is connected to a lot of other professionals who are the best in their respective field as well. &nbsp;The mortgage broker she recommended to me actually got me my home loan after three prior failed attempts with others. Izabela created a team of home buying professionals that helped me achieve what many said I wouldn't be able to achieve, especially in today's highly scrutizing home loan market.<br><br>I firmly believe Izabela Sloma is one of the city's best real estate agents. &nbsp;She is also charming and personable, while being highly professional at the same time. &nbsp;I am an extremely fastidious person, so am 100% earnest when I say to you that I strongly believe it would be in your best interest to work with Izabela Sloma.</span></p><p></p>

Each and every deal we discussed and submitted through Izabela was handled with priority and care. <br><br>Izabela knows the market very well and she</span> <span id="yui_3_18_1_1_1503415724993_4112">&nbsp;is honest about each and every place you look at it. If she sees a problem, she calls it out. If she doesn't think the unit is priced correctly, she says it. We felt that every place she looked at, she was moving into with us, that's how honest she was about places. <br><br>Izabela also was very amazing at the negotiation process. In fact, at our closing, we were issued money back, which was a huge relief! <br><br>Although, she had clients spending much more money than we did, we never felt like less of a priority to her. She was amazing to work with! <br><br>Our only gripe is that she didn't always follow up to emails promptly. However, she did ALWAYS answer our calls and get back to us with answers. But I'm the kind of person who wants an email saying your working on it so I know you received my email. <br><br>Overall, we highly recommend Izabela.</span></p><p></p>

She represented several of the properties we looked at and was the seller's agent for the home we eventually purchased. We ended up using her to sell the same home and for the purchase of our next home.</span></p><p><span>It's rare</span>&nbsp; to call your seller's agent after a home-buying experience, but I knew I wanted to use Izabela the next time around. During our initial dealings with her from "the other side," I couldn't help but notice her poise and confidence without being aggressive. She came across as honest but street smart at the same time.</p><p>I called her a year ago when we were thinking of eventually selling our home and buying a luxury home because we were so impressed with her professionalism, intelligence and her connections to both prospective buyers for our home and to the home building community. I also trusted she had a very good knowledge of the luxury home market in which we were looking, and she did not disappoint.</p><p>Izabela met with me to ascertain what we wanted in our next home and house hunted with us over several months. We covered the entire geographic market for homes in our price range and desired location! Even when we at one point changed our mind about buying a home, she was very patient and professional and did not pressure us into continuing because of her time investment.</p><p>Eventually we found a home that fit our requirements, and through Izabela we found a team to renovate the home. In the meantime, she listed our current home and had ten prospective buyers the first day it hit the market without so much as a "for sale" sign up! Her marketing efforts were spectacular; the NY Times even called wanting to feature our home in their real estate section because they liked the online pictures so much.</p><p>She was upfront, honest and respectful throughout the negotiation process as we worked to sell our home. She had referrals for repair technicians where tweaks were needed and made sure the jobs were done properly. In the end, our house is being sold for more than we purchased it thanks to her hard work and its location and condition.</p><p>My husband and I felt very comfortable with Izabela's knowledge of the luxury home market, new construction home market and her geographic knowledge of the City of Chicago. We really enjoyed her client service and personal warmth and would highly recommend her.</p><p></p>

She is super responsive, she will return my email, text or phone call immediately. &nbsp; Always keeping track and sending updates of new houses on the market. She doesn't pressure me to buy and if I don't like the <span id="yui_3_18_1_1_1503415724993_3864">&nbsp;homes I see, she says, " Don't worry we will keep looking until you find something no matter how long it takes.". &nbsp;That's one of the important qualities I like about Izabela, but the most important quality I have found in Izabela is her honesty. I completely trust her. When I don't understand something she will explain it over and over until I do. She looks out for me. She doesn't mess around and nobody can BS her when it comes to the quality of work that has been done to a home. She's on top of everything. I would recommend her in a heartbeat!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p><span>I really, really appreciate everything she has done for me.</span></p><p></p>

Izabela knew every detail about every neighborhood which aided in the decision making process. Additionally, she provided resources and connections to guide us through the &nbsp; sale and make the transaction as smooth as possible. The second transaction she helped with was selling our house. On Friday, we told Izabela that we wanted to sell our house. On Monday, it was sold for the asking price! She is a fantastic resource and a wonderful agent with superior market knowledge. I HIGHLY recommend her for buying or selling your next home.&nbsp;</p><p></p>
